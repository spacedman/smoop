Title: Smoop, smoothing over population centres
Description: For any quantity measured at a set of locations with 
	     associated population sizes at those locations, the 
	     smoop algorithm computes a smoothing of those quantities.
	     The value at any location is the average of enough nearby
	     data points to ensure it is an average from at least a given
	     population size.
